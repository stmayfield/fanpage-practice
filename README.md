# Nickelback Fan Page

## Description 

This webpage is sourced from a UCD-SAC excercise fpr "Prework Module 4." It's primary purpose is to serve as practice for understanding the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. 

This webpage also served to function as an ironic take on a fan page for a popular rock band from the late 90s and early 00s.

The webpage is hosted on GitPages and can be found at [Nickelback "Fan" Page](#)

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
