        <h1>Why Nickelback is Unwittingly the Best Band Ever</h1>
        <h2>Bio:</h2>
        <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelback" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, “The band was
            formed in the early 1990s as a cover band called "Village Idiot" by brothers Mike and Chad Kroeger with
            their cousin Brandon Kroeger and Ryan Peake. The band later changed its name to Nickelback, which originated
            from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger gave customers at his job at <em>Starbucks</em>; he
            would frequently say, "Here's your nickel back." Chad Kroeger then asked his step-father to give him $4,000
            so that the band could record their first demo, a seven-track EP of original material, called Hesher (1996).
            The band spent half the money to record the EP, and spent the other half on magic mushrooms.”</p>
        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>Nickelback has been a band that has strengthened my relationships with close friends and provided me a
            soundtrack to more than a handful of nights as a janitor. The tunes are catchy and I unironically attended a
            Nickelback concert as my first live music experience. Most people respond with “I’m sorry” when I
            communicate this information to them. That said, I recognize that the music performed by this group may
            impartially be viewed as, quite frankly, atrocious and uninspired garbage. I know it’s garbage when I listen
            to it, but much like Geroge Lucas' <em>Star Wars: Episode’s I, II, and III</em>, there’s a certain
            (hopefully self-aware) satisfaction that comes from consuming media that by any objective measurement may be
            considered a dumpster fire of an art form.</p>

        <h1><strong>So Why is Nickelback Secretly the Greatest Rock Band?</strong></h1>
        <h2>They Are Accessible to a Wide Audience</h2>
        <p>Nickelback’s lyrics are often criticized for being bland and uninspired. That’s because they are. As a
            result, the lyrics can feel broadly applicable and relatable to a diverse demographic of socially
            privileged, first-world North American and European backgrounds, thus making them one of the most accessible
            bands in the medium. This accessibility allows anyone to introduce anyone to the rock genre, or at the
            least, anyone who has never heard music before.</p>
        <h2>They Unite and Bring People of All Backgrounds Together</h2>
        <p>Nickelback has somehow established (seemingly unintentionally) an identity of being one of the worst North
            American bands in existence. This notion is so popular, the band is consistently ranked in the #1 spot on
            Ranker.com’s The Worst Bands & Musicians of All Time list. With an identity that most everyone can agree
            upon, Nickelback has single-handedly united people of all backgrounds and genre tastes in at least one
            aspect of popular culture: Nickelback sucks. In today's divisive social rhetoric, these universal stances
            can be hard to come by.</p>
